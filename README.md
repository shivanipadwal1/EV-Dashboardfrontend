# EV Dashboard

This is a dashboard for visualizing Electric Vehicle (EV) data.
## Overview

The objective of this assessment is to analyze the provided Electric Vehicle (EV) population data and create a frontend dashboard that visualizes key insights about the dataset. This repository contains the necessary data and instructions to demonstrate analytical and dashboard creation skills. 

## Dataset

The Electric Vehicle Population dataset is available in the `Electric Vehicle Population Data (CSV)` within this repository. For more information about the dataset, visit the [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).

> **Note**: The dataset has been reduced in this repository to keep the data size small for the frontend bundle.

## Tasks

### Dashboard Creation

- Design the dashboard to effectively communicate important metrics and visualizations.
- Include visual representations such as charts, graphs, or tables to showcase trends and relationships in the data.
- Ensure the dashboard is user-friendly and intuitive for exploring the dataset.

### Deployment

- Deploy your frontend dashboard to a hosting platform of your choice (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
- Make sure the dashboard is publicly accessible.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on:

- **Analytical Depth**: The depth of your analysis and insights derived from the dataset.
- **Dashboard Design**: Clarity, aesthetics, and usability of the frontend dashboard.
- **Insightfulness**: Effectiveness in conveying key insights about electric vehicles.

## Submission Guidelines

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Complete your analysis and create the frontend dashboard.
3. Deploy the dashboard to a hosting platform.
4. Update this README.md file with the URL to your live dashboard.
